* Objective-C String Constants Best Practice

When writing code for a particular platform it is important to be
mindful of idioms and best practices for that platform. Throughout
Apple's framework headers and open source code string constants are
always declared and defined consistently.

Besides matching the existing style and expectations, there are
practical reasons for declaring your string constants as Apple does.

- direct pointer comparison
- clear intent
- documentation

** Best Practice

*** Header

In a header file declare your string constant like this.

#+INCLUDE: "~/proj/Konst/KTConst.h" :lines "3-" src C

*** Implementation

In the corresponding implementation file define the constant like
this.

#+INCLUDE: "~/proj/Konst/KTConst.m" :lines "3-" src C

*** Use

Now you can use pointer comparisons rather than using ~isEqual:~ or
~isEqualToString:~.

#+INCLUDE: "~/proj/Konst/main.m" :lines "7-10" src C

** Why not use ~#define~

Preprocessor defines are great for many things, but are not great for
constants. Constants should be declared as ~const~ so the intent is
clear. Preprocessors defines, by default, only display a warning if
redefined and can be trivially suppressed. In contrast, redefining a
constant is a linker error and halts compilation.

The biggest benefit is the ability to use direct pointer comparison
which is constant time rather than ~isEqual:~ or ~isEqualToString:~
which can be O(n) at worst.
