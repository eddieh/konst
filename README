* Objective-C String Constants Best Practice

When writing code for a particular platform it is important to be
mindful of idioms and best practices for that platform. Throughout
Apple's framework headers and open source code string constants are
always declared and defined consistently.

Besides matching the existing style and expectations, there are
practical reasons for declaring your string constants as Apple does.

- direct pointer comparison
- clear intent
- documentation

** Header

In a header file declare your string constant like this.

#+INCLUDE: "~/proj/Konst/KTConst.h" :lines "3-" src C

** Implementation

In the corresponding implementation file define the constant like
this.

#+INCLUDE: "~/proj/Konst/KTConst.m" :lines "3-" src C

** Use

#+INCLUDE: "~/proj/Konst/main.m" :lines "7-10" src C
